## Backbone App()

An APP for your client app using simple conventions in Backbone.js

## Usage 

Find the compilled library in the "build/" folder. Choose between the uncompressed and comment annotated **backbone.app.js** and the minified **backbone.app.min.js** 

## Build

To build the library simply load the npm dependencies and execute the **build.js** with node: 
```
npm install
node build.js
```

The build script will combine the contents of the "lib/" folder and output the compiled library in the "build/" folder.
